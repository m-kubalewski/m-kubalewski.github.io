It took me way too long to get that whole thing going. Troubles with choosing the best looking theme were a certain thing, but god, I didn't expect Hugo to be so uncooperative. If you don't believe me, just visit my github and see some of the first commit messages. To be honest, setting up this blog wasn't that hard technically, but lack of documentation in certain themes really hits you. Someday I'll get a hang of it though, at least I hope i will.

Right now my head's full of ideas for this blog. Ideally, I plan to post daily, with each post being sort of like an episode of a show. That's just a faint idea, but it would be neat to turn some of those posts into videos, but now I think I should focus on writing.


**See you around, people**
